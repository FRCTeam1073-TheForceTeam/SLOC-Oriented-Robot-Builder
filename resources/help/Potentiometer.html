        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>A potentiometer is a variable resistor that is typically used on a robot
            to measure shaft angle or number of turns of a shaft.
            The potentiometer has a resistance that is proportional
            to the angle of the shaft on the device. There are several styles of potentiometers
            available. The potentiometers used on robots should be linear taper (not logrithmic
            as used in audio equipment for volume controls.</p>

        <p>
            Typically a potentiometer shaft can rotate about 270 degrees before hitting the
            hard stop. It is important to make sure that the mechanical system the potentiometer
            is connected to doesn't exceed the maximum rotation of the potentiometer or it
            will likely become damaged. For applications requiring more rotations, multi-turn
            potentiometers are available. Using a 10-turn potentiometer often
            simplifies the mechanical design of a system such as an elevator where the rotations
            translate into elevator height.
